# temp_manage

A simple self-use pull template project.

If you have an excellent template project, you can leave address in issue.

Do not consider npm release for the time being.

So now if you want to use it, you can only use Git.

# Install

```shell
 git clone https://github.com/wegi8/temp_manage.git
```

```shell
 npm i && npm link
```

```shell
 wegi
```

# Future

- [ ] support the `add <templateName>|<templateAddress>`
- [ ] support the `remove | del <templateName>`
